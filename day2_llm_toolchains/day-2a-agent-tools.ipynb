It has no connection to the outside world, so the agent can't take actions for you.\n\n**The Solution:** Tools are what transform your isolated LLM into a capable agent that can actually help you get things done.\n\nIn this notebook, you'll:\n\n- ✅ Turn your Python functions into Agent tools\n- ✅ Build an Agent and use it **as a tool** in another agent\n- ✅ **Build your first multi-tool agent**\n- ✅ Explore the different tool types in ADK","metadata":{"id":"g-rxFWtXeBNW"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## ‼️ Please Read\n\n> ❌ **ℹ️ Note: No submission required!**\n> This notebook is for your hands-on practice and learning only.

Both involve using multiple agents, but they work very differently:\n\n**Agent Tools (what we're using):**\n- Agent A calls Agent B as a tool\n- Agent B's response goes **back to Agent A**\n- Agent A stays in control and continues the conversation\n- **Use case**: Delegation for specific tasks (like calculations)\n\n**Sub-Agents (different pattern):**\n- Agent A transfers control **completely to Agent B**\n- Agent B takes over and handles all future user input\n- Agent A is out of the loop\n- **Use case**: Handoff to specialists (like customer support tiers)\n\n**In our currency example:** We want the currency agent to get calculation results and continue working with them, so we use **Agent Tools**, not sub-agents.","metadata":{"id":"NuIzDxfGeBNZ"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## 🧰 Section 4: Complete Guide to ADK Tool Types\n\nNow that you've seen tools in action, let's understand the complete ADK toolkit:\n\nIt's broadly divided into two categories: **Custom tools** and **Built-in tools**","metadata":{"id":"x06SZdbLeBNd"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### **1.
